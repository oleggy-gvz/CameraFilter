Android Camera Filter
===================================

A simple camera filter android application demonstrates the main features:
- display of the preview window on the device screen;
- triggering autofocus in the process of the preview;
- turning on the flash before starting the snapshot process, depending on the shading of the environment;
- taking pictures;
- processing of the taken picture with one of two filters: blur or sharpening (depending on the settings of the filter);
- record the processed image in JPEG format on the memory card.
